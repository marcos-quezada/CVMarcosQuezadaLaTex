Dear HR Manager,\\[1.5em]
%
With a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Systems Engineering, numerous years of hands-on experience creating and implementing software solutions in Mexico, USA and Germany; working for several different industries both in governmental and private institutions,
and the ability to tackle and solve problems aiming to create scalable, flexible and adaptable solutions, with the mindset of applying the appropriate tools for the right job. The possibilities involved with transports and logistics on software systems presents
a good chance to get involved in topics such as IoT, data analysis and co, being backed up from a well stablished company is a good chance to bring fresh and innovative ideas to this topics. I would like to express my interest in your posting on your website for a software engineer.

I have been part of large-scale teams as well as smaller dynamic teams, and so I understand the importance of time management, having a nice wide range of open communication channels and value the benefits of knowledge exchange with my peers with different backgrounds 
and how enriching could be a discussion over a certain concern, roadblock or an alternative solution that can provide valuable input and clarify the details often missed by focusing only on the technical details. 

Over the course of my career as a software engineer I have:

Been a part of the teams that achieved a large digital transformation on the legislative sector on Mexico, including interaction with hardware devices.

Collaborated with the team that launched the first iteration of the digital video streaming platform for Disney Studios in the USA.

Joined the innovation team for the payments company Cayan on the USA, creating proof of concept tools,to simplify management of the computational resources, and analyze historical data to prepare for peak days on transactions.

Tried out myself on the DevOps duties in addition to my regular software engineer tasks at the online restaurant reservations company Quandoo in Germany.

Become acquainted and also certified in TOGAF foundations, and had the opportunity to put that knowledge into practice.


I am a firmly believer that putting resources into research and innovation is a good investment, as it promotes the creation tools that are made specifically to meet the requirements, without any complications or workarounds. I think than more than being a programming languages
collector or some sort or walking api documentation, is more important to have understanding over the underlying concepts behind such technologies, bringing a smoother learning curve and and a rapid adaptation to new challenges.

Find attached a copy of my resume that further lists my background and technical skills. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone or via email. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you more about this opportunity.

%Yours sincerely,\\[2em] % if the opening is "Dear Mr(s) Doe,"
%Yours faithfully,\\[2em] % if the opening is "Dear Sir or Madam,"
Best regards,
